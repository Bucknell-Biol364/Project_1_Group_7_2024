- normalize a set of data that isn't normal

2. Visualizing Data 
- learn to create and analyze basic Box-Plots, Histograms, and Bar Charts.

3. Which type of analysis to use / using t-test, anova...
- Recognize need for anova test - test using anova - analyze results
- Recognize need for t test - test using t tes - analyze results
