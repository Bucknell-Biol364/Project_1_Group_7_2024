## Target Audience

People with a basic understanding and little experience of R (such as BIOL 203/204). Audience should already have R downloaded.

## Instructions

Open the file in R, read through the R Markdown and following along by running the code!

The DataSet we will be using is an excel file titled Penguins. This file includes data for penguins of three different islands. We will only be focusing on three variables: the Bill Length, the Sex, and what island the Penguins are from.

The two hypothesis you will be testing using this data is:
1. Is Bill Length in Penguins from Torgersen's Island is Sex Dependent
2. Is Bill Length is different between the 3 species


## Objectives

1. Exploring normality of data
-determine if a data set is normally distributed or not
-normalize a set of data that isn't normal

2. Visualizing Data 
- create different types of graphs to visualize data with a specific hypothesis

3. Which type of analysis to use / using t-test, anova...
- Recognize need for anova test - test using anova - analyze results
- Recognize need for t test - test using t tes - analyze results
